# EventManagementSystem

A Python,Django site that manages events where event managers can post events and interested parties can buy the events through Mpesa

Event organisers log in,and are given withdrawal id's used to withdraw proceedings from ticket sales.

UUID fields are placed on each ticket to prevent forgery

UUID's replace generic id fields to buffer site security.
